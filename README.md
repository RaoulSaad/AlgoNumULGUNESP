# About the project
This project was developed in collaboration between Université de Liège, Liège, Belgium and State University of São Paulo, UNESP, Presidente Prudente-SP, Brazil.

In this repository you will find implementations of analytical derivatives, Jacobian Matrix (the matrix of first partial derivatives) and all this will culminate in the implementation of a numerical algorithm: Newton method in order to solve one of the four general forms of equations and systems.
